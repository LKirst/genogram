# Genogram Library

The xml file contains a library, which you can load into [draw.io](https://www.diagrams.net/) (now called diagrams.net) to make genograms.

- [This page](https://www.diagrams.net/blog/custom-libraries) explains, how to load the library.
- [This page](https://www.diagrams.net/doc/faq/custom-shapes) explains, how you can create new / edit existing shapes. See also [here](https://desk.draw.io/support/solutions/articles/16000052874-how-to-create-and-edit-shapes-).

I don't know how to edit shapes in the library xml because the shape information seems to be inbedded in one long string for every shape. If there is a way, please let me know. As a workaround, I save an xml file for every shape. Then, I can edit these files, load them, add them to the library, and save the updated library. Before I add shapes to the library, I adjust their size:
- 80 x 80 for people 
- 35 x 35 for relationship symbols 
- 100 x 30 for relationship brakets

For most shapes it is also helpful to check `Constrain Proportions` before adding them to the library.
